Ember is the words first Commercially available C++ Programming langauge. It comes with out of the box libraries to do what you desire, as well as top notch documetation to help with errors. It is developed solely by me, but will soon be accepting appplications on my website (https://emberlang.com) to help develop this monstrous project.

As of now, Ember is powerfull enough to do the following (with bugs..):

1. **Create Variables**
    > Even dynamic objects!
2. **Create Functions**
3. **Object Oriented Programming** (50%)
4. **Perform loops with conditions**
    > while, and for loops, along with if and elif blocks!
5. **Import files**
6. **Use the INB lib to create windows, make servers, games, applications, interfaces, etc!**

Here is a barebones program in ember to print a question to the console, and wait for a response, then convert it to an integer:

```
string response = ask("Enter your age: ")

print("Converting to int...")

print(toint(response, true)) # True specifies that if something went wrong, we return -1 with no errors.
```
